              <h4>GOAL</h4>
              <p>The goal is to implement a small word puzzle game that presents the user with a mangled word and asks
                her to enter the correct, unmangled word. If the word to unmangle is pizza the application may present
                the word as zpaiz and the user must then enter P I Z Z A in this order for the solution to be
                accepted.</p>

              <h4>SCORING</h4>

              <h5>The scoring of the game is as follows:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>A full score is given only if the word was entered correctly on first guess without ever deleting
                  any character
                </li>
                <li>For each character that was deleted whilst entering the word -1 is subtracted from the score</li>
                <li>The maximally obtainable score for a word is max_score = floor(1.95^(n/3))where n is the number of
                  characters in the word, ^ denotes the exponential function and floor is the round-down function which
                  truncates a float to an integer
                </li>
                <li>The score for a word can never be negative, as such max_score >= score >= 0 always holds for score
                  being the actual score the user receives for solving this word A game runs for 40 seconds, during
                  which the user can solve as many words as she can manage.
                </li>
